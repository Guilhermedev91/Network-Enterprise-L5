# Network-Enterprise-L5
The main purpose of the project is to connect all the sites by configuring the network using Packet Tracer. VLANs were created to separate them. Ports that arenâ€™t being used are currently not able and sent to the management VLAN. To avoid interceptions, a VPN tunnel was created between RTR-Datacenter and Core-B, cryptographing all the data.
